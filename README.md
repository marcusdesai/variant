# Variant: Destructuring Macro

This small crate exports a single macro `variant!`, which can be used to destructure an expression into, and return assignments from, a single pattern. It works similarly to the [`matches!`][matches] macro from the rust std lib.

This macro is mainly useful for reducing matching boilerplate when you just want to try and extract some values from a pattern match (my reason for making this ðŸ˜‰).

## Example

```rust
use variant::variant;

let val = Some((0, 1));
let res = variant!(val, Some((i, _))).expect("i");
assert_eq!(res, 0);

let res = variant!(val, Some((10, j)));
assert!(res.is_err());
```
