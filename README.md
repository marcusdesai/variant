# Variant: Destructuring Macro

This small crate exports a single macro `variant!`, which can be used to destructure an expression into, and return assignments from, a single pattern. It works similarly to the [`matches!`][matches] macro from the rust std lib.

This macro is mainly useful for reducing matching boilerplate when you just want to extract some values from a pattern match (my reason for making this ðŸ˜‰).

## Examples

```rust
use variant::variant;

let val = Ok(Some(0u8));
let res: Result<u8, _> = variant!(val, Ok(Some(i)));

let err = variant!(val, Ok(1.0f32));
assert!(err.is_err());
```
